Voxel-Based Morphometry on Oasis dataset
========================================

This example uses Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM) to study the relationship
between aging and gray matter density.

The data come from the `OASIS <http://www.oasis-brains.org/>`_ project.
If you use it, you need to agree with the data usage agreement available
on the website.

It has been run through a standard VBM pipeline (using SPM8 and
NewSegment) to create VBM maps, which we study here.

Predictive modeling analysis: VBM bio-markers of aging?
--------------------------------------------------------

We run a standard SVM-ANOVA nilearn pipeline to predict age from the VBM
data. We use only 100 subjects from the OASIS dataset to limit the memory
usage.

Note that for an actual predictive modeling study of aging, the study
should be ran on the full set of subjects. Also, all parameters should be set
by cross-validation. This includes the smoothing applied to the data and the
number of features selected by the ANOVA step. Indeed, even these
data-preparation parameter impact significantly the prediction score.


Also, parameters such as the smoothing should be applied to the data and the
number of features selected by the ANOVA step should be set by nested
cross-validation, as they impact significantly the prediction score.

Brain mapping with mass univariate
-----------------------------------

SVM weights are very noisy, partly because heavy smoothing is detrimental
for the prediction here. A standard analysis using mass-univariate GLM
(here permuted to have exact correction for multiple comparisons) gives a
much clearer view of the important regions.
