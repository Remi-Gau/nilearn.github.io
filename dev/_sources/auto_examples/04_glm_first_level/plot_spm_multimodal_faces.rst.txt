Single-subject data (two sessions) in native space
==================================================

The example shows the analysis of an SPM dataset studying face perception.  The
analysis is performed in native space. Realignment parameters are provided with
the input images, but those have not been resampled to a common space.

The experimental paradigm is simple, with two conditions; viewing a face image
or a scrambled face image, supposedly with the same low-level statistical
properties, to find face-specific responses.

For details on the data, please see:
Henson, R.N., Goshen-Gottstein, Y., Ganel, T., Otten, L.J., Quayle, A.,
Rugg, M.D. Electrophysiological and haemodynamic correlates of face
perception, recognition and priming. Cereb Cortex. 2003 Jul;13(7):793-805.
http://www.dx.doi.org/10.1093/cercor/13.7.793

This example takes a lot of time because the input are lists of 3D images
sampled in different positions (encoded by different affine functions).

We actually want more interesting contrasts. The simplest contrast
just makes the difference between the two main conditions.  We
define the two opposite versions to run one-tailed t-tests.  We also
define the effects of interest contrast, a 2-dimensional contrasts
spanning the two conditions.

Based on the resulting maps we observe that the analysis results in
wide activity for the 'effects of interest' contrast, showing the
implications of large portions of the visual cortex in the
conditions. By contrast, the differential effect between "faces" and
"scrambled" involves sparser, more anterior and lateral regions. It
also displays some responses in the frontal lobe.
